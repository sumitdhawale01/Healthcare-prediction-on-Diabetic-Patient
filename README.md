# Healthcare-prediction-on-diabetic-patient

## Introduction
This project endeavors to develop a predictive model for identifying diabetes in patients using pertinent health indicators. The objective is to construct a dependable and precise machine learning model that healthcare providers can employ for proactive intervention. Early detection of diabetes is emphasized due to its potential to significantly enhance patient outcomes and curtail healthcare expenses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

## Configuration
Ensure the dataset ("health care diabetes.csv") is stored in the project directory. The Jupyter notebook ("Healthcare_prediction_on_Diabetic_Patient.ipynb") encompasses the data preprocessing steps, detailing the handling of missing values, outliers, and feature selection.

## Models and Algorithms
#### The project employs several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict diabetes outcomes.

## How to Use
Follow these steps to utilize the Healthcare Prediction on Diabetic Patients project:
1. **Clone the Repository :** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/sumitdhawale01/Healthcare-prediction-on-Diabetic-Patient.git`.
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook :** Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the **Healthcare_Prediction.ipynb** file. This notebook guides you through the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training processes.
3. **Run the Notebook :** Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell. The notebook will walk you through the steps of handling missing values, treating outliers, exploring data, and training various machine learning models for predicting diabetes in patients.

## Results
